This repository contains guides for the [FMI-LS-BUS][] layered
standard for network communication.

Note that these guides are being worked on actively, and thus are
subject to change without notice.

They are not normative, nor are they to be considered officially
endorsed by the Modelica Association or other involved organisations
prior to official adoption.

The [FMI LS BUS Implementer's Guide][ls-bus-guide] is currently
maintained on [GitHub][github-ls-bus-guide] and is published
[here][ls-bus-guide]. It is based on the [FMI-LS-BUS][] layered
standard for Network Communication.

In future additional guides might be integrated into this repository.
